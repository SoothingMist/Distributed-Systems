# Distributed Systems Courseware

This is very much an ongoing evolving project that collects quality open-access material related to understanding and implementing distributed computer systems. Your comments are always welcomed. Please open an issue and provide your input. These help the project improve.

## Files

Filesizes are too large for GitHub. FTP is used to download the files. FileZilla (https://filezilla-project.org) is an open-access FTP client you can used to get the files. Here is the access information:

    FTP Username: `CourseFiles@informationanthology.net`  
    FTP server: ftp.informationanthology.net  
    FTP and Explicit FTPS port:  21  
    FTP Permissions on Files and Directories: Read Only  
    FTP Password: GuestUser_FTP  

The resulting directory contains the following files:

LargeFiles:
Directory of files I was unable to embed into the Moodle framework because of their size. See the ReadMe within the directory for how to place the directory within Moodle's file structure.

Moodle-DistributedSystems:
The Moodle course itself. This has to be imported into the Moodle framework.

StandAloneMoodle: An explanation of installing Moodle for stand-alone operation and importing courses. *** Still working on this.
